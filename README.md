Characterize the final user
The final user will be the person who works in HR in a company I want to work in. They will be the person who decides if i get my dream job or not. I want to make a CV that is both original and serious because that's the impression I want to give to the final user. It will probably be a work in computer science, but it could be in any field. 

Information Architecture
My project will be a single page project which is responsive. I decided not to go for a multiple page layout because I think that being able to view everything as fast as possible is where the world is going towards so it wouldn't make much sense to make the final user navigate through several pages just to find out what languages I speak or what i work in.
The single page layout allows me to communicate the ideas of simplicity, cleanness and structure I want to be associated with in a professional and personal level as well as being intuitive for any public, because the person working in hr may not know anything about web page creation. 

Visual design
Continuing width my ideas of seriousness and originality i'm going for a palette that is in greys. I've found the palette with: #C9D6DF, #F0F5F9, #52616B and #1E2022 in colorhunt: https://colorhunt.co/palette/f0f5f9c9d6df52616b1e2022 and i decided to go with it. The typography I chose is Arial because I think it's the most presentable and serious one. 
To try and go as far away as possible from A4 CVs I decided to make a single page unscrollable CV where every inch of the screen is useful to transmit a message. That's why I decided to break the page into three sections. 
The top left section is used to display the most important things of the CV, which must always be visible, such as my name, profile picture, the field I want to work in and my contact Data. I decided not to add more contact information because I'm all for data protection. The bottom left part is used as a menu and to get a quick glance over the CV. Looking at it you can see the most important jobs i've had as well as languages I speak and other important information. If the final user is more interested they can always click and more information will be shown.
Finally the rightmost part is used to display a more extensive approach to the topics that appear in the menu.
